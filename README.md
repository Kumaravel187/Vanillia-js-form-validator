# Simple Form Validator

This is a basic form validator project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features

- Validates form fields using simple rules.
- Displays error messages for invalid inputs.
- Highlights the fields with errors.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-form-validator.git
   ```

# Navigate to the project directory:

1. cd simple-form-validator
2. Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

# How It Works

The form validator uses JavaScript to listen for the form's submission event. When the form is submitted, the validator function checks each input field according to specified rules. If an input field is invalid, an error message is displayed, and the field is highlighted. If all inputs are valid, the form is submitted.

# Customization

You can customize the validation rules, error messages, and styling in the script.js and style.css files according to your needs.
